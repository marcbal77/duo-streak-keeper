# 🔥 Duo Streak Keeper

### 🌍 Keep Your Language Learning Streak Alive 📚

Automatically protect your Duolingo streak by purchasing streak freezes when you need them.

> **⚠️ Important**: This uses Duolingo's unofficial API and may violate their Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.

## 🦉 What Does This Do?

This tool checks your Duolingo account and automatically buys a streak freeze (costs 💎 200 gems) if you don't already have one. This protects your 🔥 streak if you miss a day.

You can run it manually whenever you want, or set it up to run automatically once a day.

## 🎓 For Language Learners (Non-Coders)

Don't worry if you're not familiar with code! This guide will walk you through everything step-by-step.

### 📋 What You Need

- A Duolingo account with at least 💎 200 gems
- A computer (Mac 🍎, Windows 🪟, or Linux 🐧)
- About ⏱️ 15 minutes to set up

### 🚀 Quick Setup (Simplest Method)

1. **🐍 Install Python**
   - Mac 🍎: Python is already installed (open Terminal and type `python3 --version` to check)
   - Windows 🪟: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer

2. **⬇️ Download This Project**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marcbal77/duo-streak-keeper.git
   cd duo-streak-keeper
   ```

   Or download as ZIP from GitHub and unzip it.

3. **📦 Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or on Mac/Linux:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **🔐 Set Up Your Credentials**

   Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then open `.env` in any text editor and fill in your details:
   ```
   DUOLINGO_USERNAME=your_username
   DUOLINGO_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

   **Optional**: Add 📧 email notifications so you get alerts when things happen:
   ```
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
   NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
   ```

   For Gmail, you'll need an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) (not your regular password).

5. **🧪 Test It**
   ```bash
   python main.py --dry-run
   ```

   This runs in test mode (won't actually buy anything). Make sure there are no errors.

6. **▶️ Run It For Real**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   That's it! It will check your account and buy a streak freeze if needed. ✨

### ⏰ Running It Automatically Every Day

The easiest way is to use your computer's built-in scheduler.

**Mac 🍎 / Linux 🐧 (cron):**

1. Open Terminal
2. Type: `crontab -e`
3. Add this line (change the path to match where you downloaded the project):
   ```
   0 9 * * * cd /path/to/duo-streak-keeper && python3 main.py
   ```
   This runs it at 9 AM every day. ☀️

**Windows 🪟 (Task Scheduler):**

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Set trigger: Daily at 9 AM
4. Set action: Start a program
5. Program: `python`
6. Arguments: `main.py`
7. Start in: (path to your duo-streak-keeper folder)

### 🤖 Using AI Tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

You can use AI assistants to help run this project! Here's how:

1. **💬 Show the AI your setup:**
   - Share the error messages if something doesn't work
   - Copy the contents of your `.env` file (but hide your password!)
   - Show what happens when you run commands

2. **❓ Ask for help like this:**
   - "I'm trying to run duo-streak-keeper but getting this error: [paste error]"
   - "How do I set up a cron job on Mac?"
   - "What's an App Password for Gmail?"
   - "Can you explain what this Python error means?"

3. **📖 Let AI read the code:**
   - AI tools can read the source code files to understand what's happening
   - They can suggest fixes or explain how things work
   - They can help you customize settings

## 👨‍💻 For Developers

### Installation

```bash

**Docker:**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: python main.py
        env:
          DUOLINGO_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DUOLINGO_USERNAME }}
          DUOLINGO_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DUOLINGO_PASSWORD }}
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 🔐 Logs into your Duolingo account using your credentials
2. ❄️ Checks if you have a streak freeze equipped
3. 💎 Checks your gem balance
4. 🛒 If you don't have a freeze and have enough gems (200+), it buys one
5. 📧 Sends you an email notification (if configured)

## 📧 Email Notifications

You'll get emails for:
- ✅ Successfully purchased a streak freeze
- ⚠️ Low gems warning (less than 600)
- 🚨 Out of gems (less than 200)
- 💔 Streak was broken
- ❌ System errors

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**❌ "Authentication failed"**
- Check your username and password in `.env`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Try logging into Duolingo's website to verify credentials

**💎 "Insufficient gems"**
- You need at least 200 gems to buy a streak freeze
- Complete some lessons to earn more gems
- The tool will email you when you're low on gems

**✅ "Already own maximum streak freezes"**
- Good news! You already have protection
- You can own up to 2 streak freezes at once

**📧 Email notifications not working**
- For Gmail, use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833), not your regular password
- Make sure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled on your Google account
- Check that SMTP settings are correct

**🐍 Module import errors**
- Make sure you ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Check you're in the right folder
